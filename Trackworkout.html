    <h1> Track Workout for a Better 100m Time</h1>
    <h2>Warm-up</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5-10 minutes of light jogging</li>
        <li>Dynamic stretches (leg swings, high knees, butt kicks)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why even is it important to warm up?</h2>
    <h3>Physiological Efficiency and Benefits</h3>
    <p>The primary physiological goal is to prepare the body for the high force and power demands of sprinting.</p>


    <h4>Muscle Temperature:</h4>
    <p>A proper warm-up raises core and muscle temperature. Warmer muscles exhibit moremetabolic activity, faster nerve
        signal transmission, and improved elasticity, which is essential for
        powerful, rapid contractions and reducing the risk of strains or pulls.</p>

    <h4>Enhanced Blood Flow and Oxygen Delivery:</h4>
    <p>Warming up dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the working
        muscles. This delivers more oxygen and nutrients, improving metabolic efficiency and allowing muscles to work
        effectively for longer periods.</p>
    <h4>Neuromuscular Activation:</h4>
    <p> Sprinting requires rapid and efficient communication between the brain and muscles. A good warm-up, especially
        with sport-specific drills, activates the central nervous system, leading to improved coordination, faster
        reaction times, and the recruitment of more muscle fibers for explosive power. This phenomenon is known as
        Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP), where previous near-maximal muscle contractions can acutely enhance
        subsequent muscle performance.</p>
    <h4>Joint Mobility and Tissue Pliability:</h4>
    <p> Dynamic movements increase the production of synovial fluid, which lubricates joints, and enhances the flexibility and resilience of tendons and ligaments. This allows for a greater range of motion and helps the body better absorb and generate force, further reducing injury risk.</p>
    <h3>Key Principles for Efficiency</h3>
    <h4>Specificity:</h4> 
    <p>The warm-up should mimic the movements required for sprinting to activate the relevant neural pathways and muscle groups.
<h4>Progression:</h4> 
<p>The intensity must increase gradually to move the body smoothly from a resting state to high-intensity readiness without inducing early fatigue.</p>
<h4>Individualization:</h4> 
<p>Athletes should experiment to find the optimal duration and specific exercises that work best for their body and the given environmental conditions (e.g., a longer warm-up in cold weather).</p>
<h4>Mental Focus:</h4> 
<p>The warm-up period offers a valuable opportunity for mental preparation, helping sprinters to focus, visualize their race, and build confidence. </p>
